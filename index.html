                            <p>The Wellness Tracker API is a RESTful backend service I developed to serve as the core of a personal wellness application. It functions as a digital journal, allowing users to securely track and manage their habits, workouts, and recipes.</p>
                            <p>This project was built to deepen my understanding of backend development, focusing on the entire lifecycle from database design and API creation to secure authentication and cloud deployment.</p>

            <h2>BIWEEKLY NOTES</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <details>
                        <summary>14 Sept 2025</summary>
                        <div>
                            <p>The first week of my backend development journey felt overwhelming. My initial approach was a passive one, simply following instructions without a clear understanding of the "why" behind each tool. This quickly broke down when I faced a persistent database migration issue, which forced me to re-evaluate my learning process.</p>
                            <p>This roadblock became a pivotal moment. I switched to an active learning approach, independently researching each tool and how it functions within the larger system. This shift was the key to moving forward and solidified my foundational understanding of backend concepts.</p>
                            <p>Several core backend concepts that I have learnt:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>API and Frameworks:</strong> I learned that an API is a communication bridge, and a framework like FastAPI simplifies the creation of the endpoints that allow different services to talk to each other.</li>
                                <li><strong>Database Management:</strong> I now understand the distinct roles of SQLAlchemy (as an ORM for object-to-database mapping) and Alembic (as a tool for managing database schema changes and history). This provided a crucial "aha!" moment, clarifying why a migrations tool is so essential for maintaining a live database.</li>
                                <li><strong>Security & Best Practices:</strong> I implemented secure practices by hashing passwords with passlib and storing sensitive information like the database URL and a SECRET_KEY in .env files, which are crucial for managing credentials securely.</li>
                                <li><strong>Deployment Workflow:</strong> I gained hands-on experience with the complete development cycle, from writing code and a test suite with Pytest to setting up a continuous deployment pipeline with GitHub Actions and hosting the application on Render.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    </details>
